# Roulette-game

This program allows you to play a game called roulette, but a simplified version.

At the beginning of the game, you are presented with the main menu, where there are such options as "1. Registration", "2. Entrance", "3. Change balance (for admin)", "4. Exit". To select an option, simply press the button with the number of the option on your keyboard.

First, you must register, where you must come up with a unique login and password. If a user with such a login already exists, you will have to come up with another login.

Your login, password and balance will be stored in a text file (users.txt).

After successful registration, you need to log in with your login and password. If you have not entered the login or password correctly, the program will allow you to enter until you enter everything correctly.

Other possible options include exiting the program and being able to change your balance to the administrator. The administrator enters your login, his password, which he has, and then changes your balance.

After entering at the beginning of the game, you have a conditional 1000 hryvnias, which you can lose or multiply. After logging in, you will have a choice: exit the program, return to the menu, or play the game.

Next, a field with numbers from 1 to 30 will be displayed. You must enter your number. The field with your number will be colored red and after 2 seconds a random number will be displayed. If you guessed, 500 hryvnias will be added to your balance, otherwise you will lose 100 hryvnias.

You need to press "1" to continue the game. If you want to exit, press any button. You will be returned to the option selection.

If you suddenly lose everything and your balance is 0, you will see a message that you have lost everything. To play again, ask an admin to change your balance.

Have a nice game! Good luck!
